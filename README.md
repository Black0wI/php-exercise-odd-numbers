# Odd Numbers

For this PHP code exercise, create a file named `odd_numbers.php`. This file should contain a function named `odd_numbers()` which accepts one parameter. The parameter *must* be an array.

Given an array, `odd_numbers()` will return an array containing only the odd numbers from the given array in ascending order. If there are no odd numbers in the given array, `odd_numbers()` should return an empty array.

For example, given `[3, 2, 1]`, `odd_numbers()` should return `[1, 3]`.

**Note:** for this exercise, a *number* means a *whole number* or, in PHP terms, an integer value.
